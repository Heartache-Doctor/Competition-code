# competition code
Hi, this rep0sit0ry is for different competitions. I will continue to update all my competition codes here. 

* A README file will be added in each competition folder, the name of the folders represents the name of the competition.
* In each README file, you will find: language version, link to competition, my record/score, link to writeup for competition [only when I wrote a WP]

Any question is welcomed! ^_^
